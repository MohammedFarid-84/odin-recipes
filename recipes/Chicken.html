    <ul>
         <li>2 shallots, finely minced</li>
         <li>1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
         <li>1/4 cup half and half</li>
         <li>1 cup seasoned bread crumbs, divided</li>
         <li>2 tablespoons finely minced parsley, divided</li>
         <li>1 large egg</li>
         <li>2 tablespoons capers, divided</li>
         <li>1 pound ground chicken</li>
         <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
         <li>3 tablespoons olive oil, plus more as needed</li>
         <li>1 1/4 cups chicken stock</li>
         <li>1 1/2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</li>
         <li>3 tablespoons cold butter, cut into cubes</li>
     </ul>

    <h3>steps</h3>
    <ol>
         <li>
            Add half of shallots to a large bowl. Stir in Parmesan cheese, half and half, <br>
            1/3 cup bread crumbs, 1 tablespoon parsley, and egg. Roughly chop 1 tablespoon <br>
            capers and add to the bowl; add ground chicken. Season with salt, pepper, and <br>
            garlic powder. Mix gently together until everything is well incorporated. 
         </li>
         <li>
            Add remaining bread crumbs to a work surface or shallow dish.  Form chicken mixture 
            <br>
            into 12 meatballs, rolling each one lightly in bread crumbs to coat and to help 
            <br>
            shape the meatballs.   
         </li>
         <li>
            Heat oil in a large deep skillet over medium-high heat. Add meatballs to skillet and cook, 
            <br>turning occasionally, until browned on all sides, about 5 minutes, adding more oil if necessary.
            <br>Remove meatballs from skillet and set aside. 
        </li>
         <li>
            Add remaining shallot and capers to the skillet and cook stirring constantly, for 1 minute.
            <br>Pour in stock and bring to a boil. Return meatballs to the skillet, reduce heat, and simmer 
            <br>until liquid is reduced by half, stirring occasionally, to coat meatballs in the sauce, 6 to 7 minutes. 
         </li>
         <li>
            Once sauce is reduced, move meatballs to one side of the skillet and turn the heat to very low. 
            <br>Whisk in lemon juice and cold butter, stirring constantly, until well incorporated and 
            <br>slightly thickened. Stir in parsley and remove from heat. Toss meatballs well with sauce 
            <br>and serve immediately. 
         </li>

     </ol>
